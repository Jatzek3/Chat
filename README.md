**Overview**
 - Your task is to implement a UI for a chat.
 - Design is up to you. 

**All your code must be in the schoolâ€™s private repository:**
- Create new branch named chat;
- Make a Pull request from the chat branch to the master branch.

# General requirements
* Connection should be [WS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebSockets) based.  
* You should use _ws://st-chat.shas.tel_ ( or ws://chat.shas.tel) as connection url.

You always will receive an array of messages from the server - when you first connect and when somebody (including you) sends a message to the server.

# Front-to-back communication
A message that you send to the server should strictly follow protocol:

```js
{
  from: String,
  message: String,
}
```
# Back-to-front communication

You always will receive an array of messages from the server (when you first connected, and when somebody (includes you) send some message to the server.

A message that you receive from server strictly follow protocol:
```js
[{
  from: String,
  message: String,
  id: String, // unique id of the message
  time: Number, // time when the message has been received
},]
```
Note, that you can receive more than 1 message in Array (up to 100).  

**Requirements:**
* React/Redux
* Nickname should be stored in [LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) and reused across app launches.
* You should implement reconnection mechanism
* Add notifications for new messages
* Display notification **_only_** when app is **not visible**
* You should separately handle cases when the app goes online/offline
* App should properly work in latest stable chrome
* Your implementation of chat should be deployed and available anywhere by a public link. (My recommend hosting is [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)). Please add a link to the deployed app to the PR.
